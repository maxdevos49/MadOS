Architecture
=============

Each supported architecture requires its own folder. Inside the folder the following must be implemented:
- Boot sequence to launch kernel calling kernel_main
- Native tty support using the header in ../include/kernel
- A architecture defined `linker.ld` script
- A `make.config`
