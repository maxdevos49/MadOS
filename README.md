# MadOS

An operating system I am building mostly to get experience for low level development and to try something new other then web development. While I do not really know what I am doing yet I do want to make the operating system strict from the developers point of view so all software is consistent and runs well. 

### Contributions
All contributions are welcomed so long as they come with a detailed descriptions of what they do as I am still learning lots. Any pull request I do not accept I will provide a description why.

### Current Goals:
  - [ ] Working Filesystem
  - [ ] Shell
  - [ ] Processes
  - [ ] Scheduling
  - [ ] C Standard Library
  - [ ] Play Original Doom for the first time

### Compiling Dependencies:
I sourced everything from `Homebrew` and edited the formulas that did not have the initial desired configurations
- Nasm
- x86_64-elf-gcc
- x86_64-elf-binutils
    - Configured with option(s): --with-sysroot
  
### Supported Architectures:
  - x86_64 only for now. Maybe more when I learn a thing or 2.
